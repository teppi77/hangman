# A hangman game in PHP

This project is used as practice to refactor a bad code base into something better. The application can be run via the commandline or as an application on a webserver.

A number of different object-oriented approaches in PHP can be seen in the code, eg:
- Interface
- Dependency Injection
- Composer Class Autoloader
- PHPUnit Testing

# Installation

- Execute: "composer install" in the root.
- Create the autoloader classes by "composer dump-autoload" in the project root.
